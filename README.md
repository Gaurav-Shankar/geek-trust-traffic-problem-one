# geek-trust-traffic-problem-one

Goal: Finding the Shortest travelling time period.

Problem Description: https://www.geektrust.in/coding-problem

problem 1: lengaburu traffic

Goal: to go from Silk Dorb to Hallitharam in the shortest time possible.

Orbit options:

Orbit 1 - 18 mega miles & 20 craters to cross

Orbit 2 - 20 mega miles & 10 craters to cross


Vehicle options:

Bike   - 10 megamiles/hour & takes 2 min to cross 1 crater,

Tuktuk - 12 mm/hour & takes 1 min to cross 1 crater,

Car    - 20 mm/hour & takes 3 min to cross 1 crater,

Weather conditions (affects the number of craters in an orbit):
 
Sunny - craters reduce by 10%. Car, bike and tuktuk can be used in this weather.

Rainy - craters increase by 20%. Car and tuktuk can be used in this weather.

Windy - no change to number of craters. Car and bike can be used in this weather.

Note: A vehicle cannot travel faster than the traffic speed for an orbit. So even though a carâ€™s max speed is 20 megamiles/
hour, it can only go at 10 megamiles/hour if that is the traffic speed for that orbit



Prpblem 2:

King Shan now would like to visit Hallitharam and RK Puram on the same day. Write code to determine which orbits
& vehicle he should take to visit both destinations in the quickest possible time.

Orbit options:

Orbit 1 - 18 mega miles & 20 craters to cross

Orbit 2 - 20 mega miles & 10 craters to cross

Orbit 3 - 30 mega miles & 15 craters to cross

Orbit 4 - 15 mega miles & 18 craters to cross

Note: You can choose only 1 vehicle for the entire trip. You cannot change vehicle after reaching the first destination.
